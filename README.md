# CanBusHacker
This is a project to make a real time CAN packet monitoring system using Arduino and CAN BUS shield hardware. This makes a very affordable and reliable CAN packet monitor and injector.

## Prerequisites
### Hardware
* Arduino UNO
* CAN BUS Shield: Currently this project supports Can Bus Shield v1.1 product (http://www.jayconsystems.com/can-bus-shield.html). You can also purchase this from eBay.
  
  We will add support for other products as we have access to them

* OBD-II to DB9 Cable: something similar to this https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10087
* USB to PC Cable to program and transfer serial data to and from Arduino

### Software
* Python 2.7.x
* Pyside: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PySide (pip install pyside)
* PySerial: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial (pip install pyserial)

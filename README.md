# CanBusHacker
This is a project to make a real time CAN packet monitoring system using Arduino and CAN BUS shield hardware. This makes a very affordable and reliable CAN packet monitor and injector.

## Prerequisites
* Arduino UNO
* CAN BUS Shield: Currently this project supports Can Bus Shield v1.1 product (http://www.jayconsystems.com/can-bus-shield.html)
  
  We can add support for other products when we have access to them

* OBD-II to DB9 Cable: something similar to this https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10087
* USB to PC Cable to program and transfer serial to and from Arduino
